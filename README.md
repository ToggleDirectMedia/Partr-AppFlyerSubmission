Partr App Instructions

About: Partr is an _All-In-One_ app designed to help you send various platforms through a single share. By combining your contact information and social media platforms into one location, we simplify the everyday sharing process.

Login page:

When you arrive to the login page, you will see the following two options to login; Google (Gmail), or Facebook. In order to proceed to the app, please select one of the options and enter your information. Once you have entered your information into either platforms, you will be re-directed to the app&#39;s home page.

Home Page:

When you reach the homepage, you will notice that there are a variety of platforms displayed with an inactive toggle switch below each one. In order to be able to share platforms please follow these four steps.

1. Click on the platforms you wish to share and a pop-up will appear
2. Enter your information to authenticate platforms you would like to be shared
3. Once you have added your information, to activate the platform turn the toggle switch on (toggle switch will appear as green)
4. Click the QR code icon on the bottom of the home page to share your information

Added Contacts

Once you have shared your information, if you click on the added contacts button located to the right of the home page button, you will arrive to a page containing the following information:

1. How recent the share took place
2. The user&#39;s name and profile picture whom you have connected with
3. The platforms that were shared with you

On the top of the added contacts page, to the left side, you will notice a settings icon. On the settings page, you will see the following options: access the help option, option to contact our team and the option to logout.

Clicking the &quot;Help&quot; option will give you a step-by-step explanation of how the Home page and Added Contacts page works.

Clicking the &quot;Logout&quot; option will allow you to sign out of the app.

Sharing Page

In order to share your information, both users must have the app. To access the sharing page, click the QR icon on the bottom of the home page. The QR code that is based on the sharing settings you have previously selected in the home page. How the sharing works:

In order to exchange information, 1) the user receiving the information must click on the camera option below and 2) simply scan the other users QR code.

A pop-up will then appear on both devices indicating, which platforms were shared.

Once you have share your information with another user, 3) both users will simply need to click anywhere on the screen other than on the pop-up. This will make the pop-up disappear and bring you back to the QR code sharing page. 4) The user who has not yet scanned the QR code, will now have access to the camera and be able to scan the other users QR code to now receive their information.

The platforms shared by both users can be found on the added contacts page.
